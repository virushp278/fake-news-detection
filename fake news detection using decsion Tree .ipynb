    "# Today (on August 12), the Supreme Court issued notice to the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on the bail plea of Aam Aadmi Party communications-in-charge Vijay Nair in a money laundering case pertaining to the national capital's excise policy.  The Bench of justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti was hearing a SLP preferred by Nair challenging the Delhi High Court order that denied him bail.  Also Read - Supreme Court Reserves Verdict On Bail Plea Of Senthil Balaji In Money Laundering Case, Flags Delay In Trial  During the course of today's proceedings, Senior Advocate Vikram Chaudhary, appearing for Nair, cited the recent case wherein the bail plea of former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia was allowed. The Top Court had taken into consideration the prolonged incarceration of 17 months and the delay in trial.  Chaudhary said that Nair had gone about a year and 10 months of custody. He said that Sisodia, also a co-accused, was seeking bail in the cases registered by ED as well as CBI. However, Nair was granted bail by the Trial Court in the CBI case and is seeking bail only with respect to the PMLA case registered by the ED. “I am on a much higher footing,” he said.  Also Read - Supreme Court To Consider Correctness Of Kerala HC View That Mere Storage Of Child Pornography Is No Offence Under POCSO/IT Acts Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, for Nair, submitted that the trial has not commenced and one prosecution and eight supplementary complaints have been filed. It was also pointed out that 40 persons have been arranged as accused with nine complaints and case records are running into 50,000 pages. Additionally, 320 witnesses are expected to be examined  In this regard, the Court noted that “it is quite likely, going by the trend of things, that more supplementary complaints might be forthcoming.”  Also Read - Supreme Court Shocked By UP Prison Secretary Citing Model Code Of Conduct As Excuse For Not Deciding Prisoner's Remission Nair, along with co-accused persons Sameer Mahendru, Sharath Reddy, Abhishek Boinpally and Benoy Babu, were denied bail by a special judge of Rouse Avenue Courts on February 16. The trial court had noted that further investigation was still pending and it was not possible to hold that they would make no attempt to tamper with the evidence if released.  It was also observed that oral and documentary evidence suggested that Nair was also in frequent touch with various stakeholders of liquor business through different modes of communication. Their use of the said modes and App was only in pursuance of their attempt not to leave any trail of their misdeeds.

    "# The question of who will be the next BJP president and the timing of the election to that post is still hanging fire. File | Photo Credit: PTI  The question of who will be the next BJP president and the timing of the election to that post is still hanging fire, with both the BJP and the RSS getting into a huddle before the formal “samanvay” (coordination) meeting of Sangh Parivar affiliates to be held in Palakkad at the end of this month.  On Sunday evening, a marathon meeting lasting up to five hours was held at Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s residence. RSS second-in-command Dattatreya Hosabele and its joint general secretary Arun Kumar were present at the meeting, along with Mr. Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister and BJP president J.P. Nadda.   BJP and RSS re-kindle closer coordination for upcoming Assembly elections  According to top sources, the meeting took up the question of the next BJP president as well as the situation with regard to the safety of minority Hindus in Bangladesh.  “There are two schools of thought with regard to the next BJP president – one, that a working president, who will ultimately be the only candidate, be named early; another school is batting for the Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand polls to be over for any new working president to be announced,” said the source. There was no clarity on who prevailed during this meeting.  The RSS has been clear that the next BJP president is to be elected in active consultation with the RSS, unlike in the past, while the BJP is playing for time. “The results of the Lok Sabha polls have convinced the RSS that someone who will be strong enough to handle the organisation needs to be in place, while the BJP high command wants the seamless coordination between it and the president’s office as before,” added the source.\n",
